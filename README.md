# Electric-Vehicles-Market-Size-Analysis-

Market size analysis for electric vehicles involves a multi-step process that includes defining the market scope, collecting and preparing data, analytical modelling, and communicating findings through visualization and reporting. Analyzing the electric vehicles (EV) market size using Python involves several steps, including data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building for forecasting. 

Here’s a detailed breakdown of how I approach this analysis:

1. Data Collection
Firstly, gather data related to the EV market. This data can include:
•	Historical sales data of electric vehicles.
•	Data on market trends and consumer behavior.
•	Data on government policies and incentives.
•	Economic indicators that might influence the market.
•	Data from automobile manufacturers on production and sales forecasts.
Sources for this data can include industry reports, government databases, and web scraping from relevant websites.

2. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data and making it suitable for analysis. This includes:
•	Handling missing values.
•	Converting data types if necessary.
•	Normalizing or scaling the data.
•	Aggregating data to the required time intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly).

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves visualizing the data to understand underlying patterns and relationships. This can include:
•	Time series plots of EV sales.
•	Correlation analysis to identify relationships between different variables.
•	Seasonal decomposition to understand seasonal effects.

4. Model Building for Forecasting
To forecast the EV market size, I use various time series forecasting techniques. Some common methods include:
•	ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
•	SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
•	Prophet by Facebook
•	LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks for more complex patterns

Conclusion:

By following these steps, I performed a detailed analysis of the electric vehicle market size using Python. The EDA helps understand the data better, and the forecasting models provide insights into future market trends. Adjusting the model parameters and incorporating additional data can further improve the accuracy of the forecasts.
